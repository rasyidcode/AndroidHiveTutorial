## SimpleAudioPlayer

Article for this app : [here](https://www.androidhive.info/2012/03/android-building-audio-player-tutorial/)

<p>The tutorial is actually decprecated and i think it would be helpful if i could remake the apps on the tutorial using the newest api and super sexy language kotlin, so i decided to do that and i just completed it(yey for me). Here is the screenshot : </p>
